<h3>what's going on</h3>
<p>
    i'm not the most open person when it comes to my comings and goings,
    but i feel compelled to announce that i've left Arkansas for greener
    pastures in Seattle. i'm here to find my career and to blaze a new trail.
    my math, science, and programming skills have been wasted these past years.
    there's a need for something more.
</p>
<p>
    so here it goes. i've made my way here. i've got work as a cook for the time
    being. but there's more here. something i can sell here that people don't
    want in Eastern Arkansas. i'm an engineer, as always. the way is lit,
    and i'd be remiss to let another opportunity slide by.
</p>
<p>
    i don't want to be a chef. i like cooking ok, but it's a comfort for me
    to make something good. so i'll be a programmer/software developer/hacker.
    i like working on the things that make computers useful: linear algebra,
    differential equations, interfaces, and tools.
